# Ryerson Big Data Capstone Project
# Predicting Image Sentiment

## Project Abstract

### Problem

Much work has been done using text to identify sentiment in social media posts.
However, much social media communication is image-based.  
Classifying sentiment from these images has proved to be a larger challenge, 
partially because of the difficulty in obtaining sufficient training data.

### Approach and Data

I propose to develop an unsupervised image sentiment classifier based on 
streamed Twitter data.

### Methodology

First, I will generate a sentiment label based on text-based sentiment analysis, 
taking into account both the original tweet and responses.

I will use these text-derived sentiments to train a Neural-Network based 
predictor on the tweeted images.
