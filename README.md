# Ryerson Big Data Capstone Project
# Predicting Image Sentiment

## Project Abstract

### Overview

These are the files for my Capstone Project in Ryerson University's Big Data
Analytics certificate program.

The project attempts to classify sentiment in images.  The model
I am building will define image sentiment of Twitter images based on the
text that is posted accompanying those images. That model will be tested 
against fresh Twitter data and against images whose sentiment has been 
determined by crowd-sourcing.
